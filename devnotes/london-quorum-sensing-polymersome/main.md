# Overview

Quorum sensing polymersomes' membranes will be made out of diblock copolymers which self-assemble to form a bilayer, similarly to lipids. These polymersomes will be a chassis for genetic circuits responsive to quorum sensing molecules (acyl-homoserine lactone) produced by biofilms and will contain PURE to express these circuits. The polymersomes will also contain X-gal which will be cleaved by beta-galactosidase when AHL is present to produce a visible indigo dye. The polymersomes will be integrated into hydrogel via 3D printing.

## How The Module Works
Polymersomes will be made by phase transfer and will encapsulate PURE and LuxR inducible circuits that express beta-galactosidase. LuxR will activate expression of beta-galactosidase when AHL is present. The polymersomes will also contain X-gal which will be cleaved by beta-galactosidase when expression is activated. These polymersomes will be intergrated into an agarose hydrogel patch that can be placed on a AHL producing biofilm.

## Milestones


- Create polymersomes encapsulating PURE and compare to lipid GUVs
    - **Risk**: Osmolarity imbalance from PURE causing membrane instability
    - **Success Criteria**: GFP expressing in stable polymersomes
- Integrate polymersomes into hydrogel that is stable for 3-4 hours. Outperforming DOPC standard GUVs in terms of time remaining stable.
    - **Risk**: Polymersomes unstable in hydrogel
    - **Mitigation**: Test different concentrations of hydrogel to assess optimal concentration for polymersome stability
- Insert alpha-hemolysin into polymersome membranes
    - **Risk**: Alpha-hemolysin not inserting
    - **Mitigation**: Test insertion in different polymer compositions
    - **Success Criteria**: Successful calcein leakage assay
- Expressing beta-galactosidase from quorum sensing circuits
    - **Risk**: AHL not diffusing sufficiently through hydrogel into polymersome
    - **Mitigation**: Permeability tests in different polymer compositions
    - **Success Criteria**: Produce X-gal/CPRG color change in polymersomes integrated in hydrogel
