title: "IV-HSL Emitter Cell"
abstract: |
  The Emitter Cell is a synthetic cell that produces and releases the signaling molecule IV-HSL to communicate with E. coli bacteria, serving as a foundation for creating Responder Cells that can detect molecular inputs and amplify signals in co-culture systems.
---

# Overview

The Emitter Cell produces and releases a chemical signal molecule into the environment. This capacity provides an example of enzymatic small-molecule production, molecule release as a reporter output,  inter-cell communication, and co-culture of synthetic cells with living bacteria. The Emitter Cell is largely based on a paper by Jefferson M Smith, Denis Hartmann, and Michael J. Booth: [Engineering cellular communication between light-activated synthetic cells and bacteria](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41589-023-01374-7).

In this first Emitter, the cell produces and releases N-isovaleryl-L-homoserine lactone (IV-HSL). IV-HSL is a branched acyl-homoserine lactone with several advantages for use in the Emitter Cell: it is able to cross the synthetic cell membrane; its uncommon branched-chain structure makes it orthogonal from many other HSLs [Lindemann, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1114125108); and it is able to activate expression in signal receiver cells (in this case, E. coli) at very low (picomolar) concentrations [Lindemann, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1114125108). The IV-HSL signal is received by a population of E. coli cells, which respond by producing a fluorescent output.

The [Detector Cells](https://docs.nucleus.engineering/docs/modules/detector-tetr-atc/spec/) and Emitter together form the basis for an upcoming Responder Cell; a synthetic cell which can detect a molecular input (such as aTc or IV-HSL itself), and produce a molecular output (IV-HSL) in response. Coupling Detector and Emitter modules will enable signal amplification, where a low amount of a molecule of interest can activate a large population of Responder cells and generate an output that is easy to detect. IV-HSL-detecting Responder Cells could also detect the production of IV-HSL from living cells, providing a means to report on their state in co-culture.

# Design

The Emitter Cell implements the [IV-HSL Emitter Module](https://docs.nucleus.engineering/docs/modules/emitter-ivhsl/spec/) within a synthetic cell. The Emitter Module produces the BjaI enzyme under the control of a constitutive T7 promoter. BjaI produces IV-HSL from two substrate molecules, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and isovaleryl coenzyme A (IV-CoA). IV-HSL diffuses out of the cell, through the lipid bilayer.

### Step 1: Pre-culture BjaR receiver cells

1. Prepare glycerol stock of BjaR receiver cells
   - Transform XL-10 Gold competent *E. coli* with `bjaR-GFP-native`:
     - Add 1–5 µl containing 1 pg–100 ng of plasmid DNA `bjaR-GFP-native` to 50 µl of XL10-Gold cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube 4–5 times to mix cells and DNA. **Do not vortex.**
     - Place the mixture on ice for 15 minutes. Do not mix.
     - Heat shock at exactly 42°C for 40 seconds. Do not mix.
     - Place on ice for 5 minutes. Do not mix.
     - Pipette 950 µl of room temperature SOC into the cell mixture.
     - Shake the cell mixture vigorously (250 rpm) at 37°C for 60 minutes.
     - Warm Ampicilin LB agarose plates at 37°C for 10 mins.
     - Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting, then perform several 10-fold serial dilutions in LB.
     - Spread 50–100 µl of each dilution onto a Ampicilin agarose plate and incubate overnight for ~15 hrs at 37°C.
2. Prepare a streak plate from the glycerol stock ([reference](https://www.addgene.org/protocols/streak-plate/))
   - Streak a Ampicillin LB plate from the glycerol stock and incubate overnight at 37C.
3. Prepare M9 Media containing 1× M9 salts, 0.34 mg/ml−1 thiamine hydrochloride, 0.2% casamino acids, 2 mM MgSO4, 100 µM CaCl2 and 0.4% (wt/vol) glucose.
4. Pick a colony from the *E. coli* streak plate, and inoculate a 5 mL culture tube containing the M9 media with 100 ug/mL carbenicillin.
5. Incubate the cells at 37 °C, 225 rpm, for 3 h. *Prepare Emitter liposomes while the cells incubate.*
6. Dilute the culture media with the pre-warmed M9 media until OD600 = ~0.1.
7. Balance osmolarity of the culture media with PURE (inner solution in liposomes) by adding glucose to the M9 media:

### Step 2: Prepare lipids-in-oil solution, outer solution, and substrate stock solutions

1. Prepare lipids-in-oil (mineral oil) solution.
	- Clean glass syringes. Pour a small amount of 95% ethanol into a glass container (e.g. a 10 mL beaker).Assemble the glass syringe and prime it by drawing ethanol into the glass syringe, then empty into a waste bottle. 
	- Use glass syringes to add lipids, as shown in the table below, into the 10 ml glass vial containing 1 ml of mineral oil (final lipid concentration is 5 mg/ml).
	- Heat the lipids-in-oil mixture on a hotplate at 55 C for 3 hrs. 
	- Vortex the lipids-in-oil mixture for 1 min. 
	- The lipids-in-oil mixture can be stored at 4 C for up to 3 days.

### Step 4: Encapsulate PURE reactions into Liposomes

*Some tips and tricks can be found in [PURE Cell](https://docs.nucleus.engineering/docs/modules/base-cell/spec/).*

1. Set up a microfuge tube rack, with three 1.5 mL microfuge tubes per liposome encapsulation:
   - Number the tubes per the number of reactions assembled in Step 3.
   - For each reaction, label the two tubes:
     - **I** — Oil emulsion
     - **O** — Outer solution
2. Add 30 ul of PURE reactions prepared in **Step 3** to tubes labelled **I**.
3. Add 180 uL of the lipids-in-oil mixture on top of the PURE reactions in tubes labelled **I** and pipette vigorously until the emulsion becomes cloudy.
4. Add 300 uL of outer solution to each of the tubes labelled **O**.
5. Add 210 uL of the milky solution carefully on top of the outer solution in the tubes labelled **O.**
6. Centrifuge at 9000 rpm at 4c for 10 mins.
7. Remove the top oil and resuspend the pellet in 100 ul of outer solution.
8. Collect the liposomes.

(step-5)=
### Step 5: Measure and Image Liposomes and Cells

**Imaging using confocal microscopy (Operetta CLS):**

While microscopy setups may vary, our performance data was collected using the following configuration.

1. Add BjaR receiver cells prepared in Step 1 into 384 Well Glass Bottom Microplates.
2. Add 10 uL of liposomes made in Step 3 on top of the receiver cells in 384 Well Glass Bottom Microplates.
3. Imaging conditions using Operetta:
   - Temperature: 37 C degree
   - Green fluorescence channel (200 us expsoure 95%) - excitation: 460-490 nm; emission: 500-550 nm.
   - Red fluorescence channel (50 us exposure 95%) - excitation: 530-560 nm; emission: 570-650 nm.
   - Brightfield (20 us 95%)
   - We capture a 6 h time lapse with 10 min intervals.
   - We also acquired z-stack images spanning from 0 µm to 80 µm of the focal plane.

**Measuring usinng plate reader (BioTek Cytation 5):**

1. Add BjaR receiver cells prepared in Step 1 into 96 Well Glass Bottom Microplates.
2. Add 10 uL of liposomes made in Step 3 on top of the receiver cells in 96 Well Glass Bottom Microplates.
3. Procedures:
   - Temperature: 37 C degree
   - Read the fluorescence intensity from the bottom
   - Excitation wavelength: 485 nm ; Emission wavelength: 528 nm
   - We capture a 6 h time lapse with 5 min intervals

# Performance Data

Emitter Cells were constructed following  and co-cultured with E. coli containing the `bjaR-GFP-native` IV-HSL receiver plasmid. We performed time-series confocal microscopy (Revvity Operetta CLS) over 8 hours, collecting red (Rhodamine-B) and green (GFP) fluorescence, and brightfield images at 40x magnification across multiple fields per well, such that the entirety of each well was imaged. Timepoints were approximately 15 minutes apart.

## The Emitter Cell causes E. coli to express GFP in response to IV-HSL.

*Emitter Cell Timeseries.* *(Positive)* Liposomes contain PURE and 100 nM IV-HSL. *(Negative)* Liposomes contain PURE supplemented with SAM and IV-HSL, but no DNA encoding BjaI. *(Emitter)* Liposomes contain PURE expressing BjaI from `pT7-bjaI`. Exposures are matched between wells. Each field of view is 167 uM wide.

*Emitter Cell Endpoint Z-Stack.* Z-stack, single field of view of the Emitter Cell after the final timeseries timepoint (>8h). Liposomes preferentially form a layer on the surface of the cover slip, occluding many of the _E. coli_ cells from the bottom layer imaged during the timeseries. More activated _E. coli_ cells become visible at longer focal distances (higher in the liquid column of the well).
